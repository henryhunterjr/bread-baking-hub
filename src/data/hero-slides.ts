      <h3>Chapter 1: What is Yeast Water?</h3>
      <p>Yeast water is one of the oldest forms of natural leavening, predating sourdough starters by thousands of years. It's created by fermenting fruit, herbs, or even vegetables in water to capture wild yeasts.</p>
      <p>Unlike sourdough starters, yeast water doesn't require daily feeding or maintenance. It's perfect for bakers who want the benefits of wild yeast without the commitment...</p>

      <p>If you've ever felt personally attacked by a jar of bubbling flour and water, welcome to the world of sourdough. Your starter is a living, breathing diva—demanding, moody, and occasionally unpredictable. But once you learn how to handle its quirks, it'll reward you with the best bread you've ever tasted.</p>
      <p>Think of your starter as a low-maintenance pet that lives in your kitchen. It doesn't need walks or belly rubs, but it does need food, warmth, and patience...</p>

      <h3>Chapter 2: "Understanding Vitale - Reading Your Starter's Language"</h3>
      <p>After ten years with Vitale, I've learned that sourdough starters communicate if you know how to listen. The key to mastery isn't following rigid rules – it's learning to read your starter's signals.</p>
      <p><strong>The Morning Ritual</strong><br>Every morning, I observe Vitale before thinking about feeding schedules. I look, smell, and yes – listen. A healthy starter makes tiny pops as bubbles break the surface. It's the sound of life.</p>
      <p><strong>Visual Cues That Matter</strong><br>Vitale's surface tells me everything: bubbles and slight doming mean active fermentation – perfect for milder loaves. If she's fallen with liquid on top, she's past peak but ready for tangier, complex flavors.</p>
