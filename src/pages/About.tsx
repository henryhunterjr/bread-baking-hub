              <p className="text-lg text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed mb-6">
                I didn't set out to become a bread baker. I was in the Army when it started. A landlord named Herr Sherman, a rotund Jewish baker, pulled me into his kitchen and put me to work. I carried flour sacks, scrubbed floors, wiped counters. I didn't think of it as baking. I thought of it as rent.
              </p>
              <p className="text-lg text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
                But somewhere between those long hours and flour-dusted nights, I was absorbing something deeper. The patience. The rhythm. The transformation. I didn't know it then, but I was being mentored in a craft that would later define me.
              </p>
            </div>

            <p>
              After the military, I spent 26 years in advertising and marketing. Leading campaigns, building brands, working in boardrooms. But bread kept calling me back. During a particularly rough season in life, I returned to the simplicity of flour, water, salt, and time. What started as therapy became a passion. Then an obsession. Then a mission.
            </p>
            
            <p>
              That mission became Baking Great Bread at Home. A Facebook group I launched to help everyday people make artisan-quality bread in their own kitchens. No fluff. No gimmicks. Just honest teaching, tested methods, and real results. Today, that community has grown to over 38,000 members and counting.
            </p>
            
            <p>
              My goal has always been to demystify bread. To take the mystery out of sourdough starters, proofing schedules, hydration ratios, and give people confidence in the kitchen. I teach not just how, but why things work.
            </p>
            
            <p>
              I've written five books on bread and baking. I develop tools and apps to help home bakers succeed. I partner with companies whose products I actually use and believe in. But most importantly, I'm still here in the community every day, answering questions and learning alongside everyone else.
            </p>
            
            <p>
              This website is the next step. A place where home bakers can learn, grow, and share, whether they're baking their first loaf or perfecting their tenth hundred.
            </p>
            
            <p>
              This isn't just about bread. It's about connection. It's about reclaiming something real in a world of shortcuts. And I'm honored you're here to be part of it.
