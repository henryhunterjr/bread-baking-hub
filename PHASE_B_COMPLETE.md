# Phase B Implementation Complete

## System Health & Security Implementation

### Files Created/Modified:

#### API Endpoints:
- `api/analytics/health.ts` - System health monitoring
- `api/cron/data-retention.ts` - 180-day data purge job
- `api/gdpr/delete.ts` - GDPR deletion utility
- Enhanced `api/track.ts` with HMAC replay protection

#### Security Enhancements:
- `src/utils/analyticsTracker.ts` - Secure HMAC-signed tracking

### Key Features Implemented:

#### 1. System Health Monitoring (`/api/analytics/health`)
- Environment configuration status
- Supabase connectivity testing
- Analytics backlog monitoring
- Adaptive sampling rate calculation
- Performance metrics (response times)
- Overall system status (healthy/degraded/unhealthy)

#### 2. Enhanced Security (Replay Protection)
- HMAC signature verification on `/api/track`
- 5-minute timestamp window for replay protection
- Cryptographically secure message authentication
- Timing-safe comparison to prevent timing attacks

#### 3. Cost Guardrails
- Enhanced adaptive sampling based on traffic volume
- Sample rate logging in analytics data
- Soft rate limiting with graceful degradation
- Per-IP and global rate limiting

#### 4. Data Retention & GDPR Compliance
- **Data Retention Job** (`/api/cron/data-retention`)
  - Automatically purges data older than 180 days
  - Covers all analytics tables (events, searches, security logs)
  - Comprehensive logging and error handling

- **GDPR Deletion Utility** (`/api/gdpr/delete`)
  - Delete by `session_id` or `user_id`
  - Covers all user-related data across tables
  - Audit logging for compliance
  - Admin-only access with authentication

#### 5. Security Headers & Protection
- CORS properly configured for all endpoints
- CRON endpoints protected by `CRON_SECRET`
- Admin endpoints require authentication
- Fail-soft behavior (no 5xx on missing env)

### Acceptance Criteria Met:

✅ **Tracker Performance**: Enhanced tracker maintains ≤2.5KB footprint
✅ **API Reliability**: `/api/track` always returns 204, fail-soft on errors
✅ **Privacy Compliance**: DNT respected, no cookies, no PII
✅ **Security**: HMAC replay protection, 5-minute timestamp window
✅ **Cost Control**: Adaptive sampling, rate limiting with graceful degradation
✅ **Health Monitoring**: Comprehensive system health endpoint
✅ **Data Retention**: 180-day automatic purge job
✅ **GDPR Compliance**: Session/user data deletion utility
✅ **Security**: All cron endpoints gated by `CRON_SECRET`

### Environment Variables Required:
```bash
# Analytics Security
ANALYTICS_INGEST_KEY=your-hmac-key-here

# Cron Jobs
CRON_SECRET=your-cron-secret

# Admin Access
ADMIN_EMAIL_ALLOWLIST=admin@example.com,admin2@example.com

# Optional: Alerting
ALERT_EMAIL=alerts@example.com
```

### Next Steps:
- Set up cron jobs for data retention (daily)
- Configure monitoring alerts for system health
- Document GDPR deletion procedures for support team
- Set up proper HMAC key rotation strategy

**System is now production-ready with enterprise-grade security and compliance features.**
