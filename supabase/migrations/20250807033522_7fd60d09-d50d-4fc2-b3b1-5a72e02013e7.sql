    "story": "When I was stationed in Germany, my landlord, Mr. Sherman, ran the bakery downstairs. He was stout, spirited, and full of lifeâ€”and a bit too smart for his own good. I was a young, healthy, muscular soldier, and he decided to put me to work. He claimed it was to \"keep my rent low,\" but I''m pretty sure he just saw me as cheap labor.\n\nA few days a week, I worked for him in the bakery. It may as well have been Home Depot for all I knew about bread at first. But every Thursday, I''d watch him make his challah, a braided bread so beautiful it practically flew off the shelves.\n\nOne day, I asked him, \"What''s so special about this bread, and why do people only come for it once a week?\"\n\nMr. Sherman paused, looking at me as if he were deciding my fate. Then he said, \"Come here, Henry. Wash your hands.\"\n\nHe put me to work shaping and braiding loaves of challah. I was terribleâ€”clumsy and slowâ€”but he was patient. As we worked, he explained the bread''s significance:\n\nâ€¢ The braids represent unity, community, and connection.\nâ€¢ Shaping it into a circle symbolizes the unending cycle of life, renewal, and continuity.\nâ€¢ The small piece of dough wrapped in aluminum foil and tossed into the back of the oven? It''s an offering, a way to give thanks and honor tradition.\n\nMr. Sherman would say a quiet prayer over the bread before it went into the oven. I had no idea at the time how much this simple act would influence me.\n\nToday, I still say that same prayer and toss a piece of dough wrapped in foil into the back of my oven. It''s my offering, my remembrance of him, and my way of honoring the traditions he shared with me.\n\nMr. Sherman planted a seed in me, and it grew into my passion for baking. I have him to thank for every loaf of bread I make today.\n\nNow, I want to share this special loaf of challah with youâ€”a beautiful braided circle to celebrate life, unity, and tradition. Let''s bake together!",
